It will have to be a two step process as mentioned in the linked issue (https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/calyxos/-/issues/295)\n\nWe can\u0027t change both signing key and package name at the same time, so we\u0027ll have to ship 1 build with just the signing key changed, and then we\u0027ll be able to change the package name in a future build.\n\nPackage name changes require both packages to have the same signature.",
