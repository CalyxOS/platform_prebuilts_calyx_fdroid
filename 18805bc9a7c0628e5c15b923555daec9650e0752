      "message": "Yes, this commit is raw output.  We need to decide which path forward to make a working setup. One short term solution is just to manually make the commit, and not include changes that are not wanted.\n\nIn a meeting a while back, you mentioned you were going to try something with Android.bp I think.  Or I could easily generate quoting here.  Properly quoting the file names the real solution IMHO, whether that means adding quotes to Makefiles or using Android.bp.\n\nWhat would be really helpful is a bare minimum setup that would let me call the Android build system to run this one.  Then I could add that to CI even.",
